  abstract = {The aim of this review paper is to enlighten some recent progresses in quantum optical metrology in the part of quantum efficiency measurements of photo-detectors performed with bi-photon states.             The intrinsic correlated nature of entangled photons from Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion phenomenon has opened wide horizons to a new approach for the absolute measurement of photo-detector quantum efficiency, outgoing the requirement for conventional standards of optical radiation; in particular the simultaneous feature of the creation of conjugated photons led to a well known technique of coincidence measurement, deeply understood and implemented for standard uses.             On the other hand, based on manipulation of entanglement developed for Quantum Information protocols implementations, a new method has been proposed for quantum efficiency measurement, exploiting polarisation entanglement in addition to energy-momentum and time ones, that is based on conditioned polarisation state manipulation.             In this review, after a general discussion on absolute photo-detector calibration, we compare these different methods, in order to give an accurate operational sketch of the absolute quantum efficiency measurement state of the art.},

They can be remarkably sophisticated, with recent successes ranging from single molecule microscopy to imaging far-distant galaxies. However, new imaging technologies based on quantum principles are gradually emerging. They can either surpass classical approaches or provide novel imaging capabilities that would not otherwise be possible. \{Here \}we provide an overview \{of the most recently developed quantum imaging systems, highlighting the non-classical properties of sources such as bright squeezed light, entangled photons, and single-photon emitters that enable their functionality.\} We outline potential upcoming trends and the associated challenges, all driven by a central inquiry, which is to understand whether quantum light can make visible the invisible.},

  abstract = {We report on multi-photon statistics of correlated twin beams produced in a periodic poled micro-ring resonator on thin-film lithium niobate. Owing to high cavity confinement and near perfect quasi-phase matching, the photons pairs are produced efficiently in single modes at rates reaching 27 MHz per \${\textbackslash}mu\$W pump power. By using a pump laser whose pulse width impedance matches with the cavity, those photons are further created in single longitudinal modes with purity reaching 99{\textbackslash}\%, without relying on later-on filtering. With a dual-channel photon-number resolving detection system, we obtain directly the joint detection probabilities of multi-photon states up to three photons, with high coincidence to accidental contrast for each. Used as a single photon source, it gives heralded \$g\_H{\textasciicircum}\{(2)\}(0)\$ around 0.04 at a single photon rate of 650 kHz on chip. The findings of our research highlight the potential of this nanophotonic platform as a promising platform for generating non-classical, few-photon states with ideal indistinguishability, for fundamental quantum optics studies and information applications.},

  abstract = {Computing Power of Quantum Mechanics                            There is much interest in developing quantum computers in order to perform certain tasks much faster than, or that are intractable for, a classical computer. A general quantum computer, however, requires the fabrication and operation a number of quantum logic devices (see the Perspective by                                Franson                              ).                                Broome                 et al.                              (p.               794               , published online 20 December) and                                Spring                 et al.                              (p.               798               , published online 20 December) describe experiments in which single photons and quantum interference were used to perform a calculation (the permanent of a matrix) that is very difficult on a classical computer. Similar to random walks, quantum walks on a graph describe the movement of a walker on a set of predetermined paths; instead of flipping a coin to decide which way to go at each point, a quantum walker can take several paths at once.                                Childs                 et al.                              (p.               791               ) propose an architecture for a quantum computer, based on quantum walks of multiple interacting walkers. The system is capable of performing any quantum operation using a subset of its nodes, with the size of the subset scaling favorably with the complexity of the operation.                        ,                             Optical circuits are used to demonstrate a quantum-enhanced calculation.                                [Also see Perspective by                 Franson                 ]                                       ,              Although universal quantum computers ideally solve problems such as factoring integers exponentially more efficiently than classical machines, the formidable challenges in building such devices motivate the demonstration of simpler, problem-specific algorithms that still promise a quantum speedup. We constructed a quantum boson-sampling machine (QBSM) to sample the output distribution resulting from the nonclassical interference of photons in an integrated photonic circuit, a problem thought to be exponentially hard to solve classically. Unlike universal quantum computation, boson sampling merely requires indistinguishable photons, linear state evolution, and detectors. We benchmarked our QBSM with three and four photons and analyzed sources of sampling inaccuracy. Scaling up to larger devices could offer the first definitive quantum-enhanced computation.},
