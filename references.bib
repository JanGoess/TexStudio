The corresponding false-alarm probability is at least 1 - exp(-K). For fixed-rate noise, one can improve the detection and false-alarm probabilities by reducing t. Moreover, when background-light noise is significant and dominates dark-current noise and when the laser signal is of the order of ten photoelectrons or more, the probabilities can be improved by reducing the amount of light falling on the detector, even if the laser signal is reduced by the same factor as the background light is.

  abstract = {Quantum imaging is a multifaceted field of research that promises highly efficient imaging in extreme spectral ranges as well as ultralow-light microscopy. Since the first proof-of-concept experiments over 30 years ago, the field has evolved from highly fascinating academic research to the verge of demonstrating practical technological enhancements in imaging and microscopy. Here, the aim is to give researchers from outside the quantum optical community, in particular those applying imaging technology, an overview of several promising quantum imaging approaches and evaluate both the quantum benefit and the prospects for practical usage in the near future. Several use case scenarios are discussed and a careful analysis of related technology requirements and necessary developments toward practical and commercial application is provided.},

The correlated beams are assumed to be generated using parametric downconversion, and the photon streams in the correlated beams are modeled by two partially correlated Poisson point processes. An exact expression for the mean rate of coincidence registration is developed using techniques from renewal theory.

The error between the exact and approximate coincidence rates increases as the coincidence-noise parameter, defined as the mean number of uncorrelated photons detected per coincidence resolving time, increases.

  abstract = {Single photon detectors are important for a wide range of applications each with their own specific requirements, which makes necessary the precise characterization of detectors. Here, we present a simple and cost-effective methodology of estimating the dark count rate, detection efficiency, and afterpulsing in single photon detectors purely based on their counting statistics. This methodology extends previous work [IEEE J. Quantum Electron., vol. 47, no. 9, pp. 1251--1256, Sep. 2011], [Electron. Lett., vol. 38, no. 23, pp. 1468--1469, Nov. 2002]: 1) giving upper and lower bounds of afterpulsing probability, 2) demonstrating that the simple linear approximation, put forward for the first time in [Electron. Lett. , vol. 38, no. 23, pp. 1468--1469, Nov. 2002], yields an estimate strictly exceeding the upper bound of this probability, and 3) assessing the error when using this estimate. We further discuss the requirements on photon counting statistics for applying the linear approximation to different classes of single photon detectors.},

  abstract = {As a tutorial, we examine the absolute brightness and number statistics of photon pairs generated in spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) from first principles. In doing so, we demonstrate how the diverse implementations of SPDC can be understood through a single common framework, and use this to derive straightforward formulas for the biphoton generation rate (pairs per second) in a variety of different circumstances. In particular, we consider the common cases of both collimated and focused Gaussian pump beams in a bulk nonlinear crystal, as well as in nonlinear waveguides and micro-ring resonators. Furthermore, we examine the number statistics of down-converted light using a non-perturbative approximation (the multi-mode squeezed vacuum), to provide quantitative formulas for the relative likelihood of multi-pair production events, and explore how the quantum state of the pump affects the subsequent statistics of the down-converted light. Following this, we consider the limits of the undepleted pump approximation, and conclude by performing experiments to test the effectiveness of our theoretical predictions for the biphoton generation rate in a variety of different sources.},

Utilizing optical nonlinearity for the generation of entangled photons remains the most widely used approach due to its quality and simplicity. The on-chip integration of entangled light sources has enabled the increase of complexity and enhancement of stability compared to bulk optical implementations. Entanglement over different optical paths is uniquely suited for photonic chips, since waveguides are typically optimized for particular wavelength and polarization, making polarization- and frequency-entanglement less practical. In this review we focus on the latest developments in the field of on-chip nonlinear path-entangled photon sources.

We also discuss a range of important technical issues, in particular the on-chip separation of the pump and generated entangled photons.
